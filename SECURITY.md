# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub's private reporting flow:

1. Go to this repository → **Security** tab
2. Open **Advisories**
3. Click **New draft security advisory**
4. Include:
   - a short description of the issue
   - steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if safe)
   - affected versions/commits (if known)
   - impact assessment (what an attacker can do)

We will respond as soon as possible and coordinate a responsible disclosure.
